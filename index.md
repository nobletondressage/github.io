  -Policically Correct aka "Carter" is a 12 yr old, 17 hand KWPN cross gelding, schooling PSG. Carter is the consummate athlete. He had a successful career as an event horse up to Preliminary before he made the career change to dressage. Carter is incredibly talented, with three very impressive gaits. His flying changes are big and expressive and the extended gaits are a highlight. Carter is light off the leg and soft in the contact in either the snaffle or         double. He would make a super upper - level horse for a capable amateur or young rider.
